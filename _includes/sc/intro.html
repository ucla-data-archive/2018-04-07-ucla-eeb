  Ecologists and evolutionary biologists increasingly 
  depend on data sharing, complicated big data 
  sets and custom analysis software. Journals are 
  increasingly asking that scientists share their data 
  and analysis code for review (see: "<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02741-4">Does your code stand up to scrutiny? Nature March 6th, 2018.</a>"). 
  Learning how to manage your data and code effectively 
  is now a critical part of graduate education in 
  ecology and evolutionary biology. We can't teach everything 
  in two days, but we have tried to select lessons from the 
  Software Carpentry curriculum that will be most helpful 
  for graduate students and other researchers in the 
  EEB department at UCLA.

  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

  The instructors for this workshop will be Andy Kleinhesselink 
  a postdoc working in Dr. Kraft's lab here at UCLA
  and Tim Dennis who is a data librarian and Director 
  of the Social Sciences Data Archive at UCLA.
